# Final Project: Data Analysis with PySpark

## Objective
The aim of this project is to apply your knowledge of PySpark to analyze a dataset of your choice. You will demonstrate your ability to manipulate data, perform transformations, and extract insights using PySpark features.

## Project Overview
1. **Select a Dataset**: Choose a dataset relevant to your interests. This dataset could be from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other source that provides structured data. Examples include:
   - Sales data
   - Social media interactions
   - Weather data
   - Financial stocks
   - Online retail transactions

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.
   - Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA):
     - Display the schema of the DataFrame.
     - Show the first few rows of the dataset.
     - Perform summary statistics.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing values through methods such as substitution or removal.
   - Correct any data inconsistencies (e.g., duplicated entries).

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Apply transformations to derive new columns or modify existing ones as required by your analysis. For example, if working with sales data, you might want to create a new column for sales per customer.
   - Use PySpark functions to group or aggregate your data as necessary.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conduct an analysis based on your questions or hypotheses. This could include:
     - Time series analysis (if applicable)
     - Statistical comparisons (e.g., sales before and after a marketing campaign)
     - Correlation analysis between different variables.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to represent your findings (you can utilize libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn alongside PySpark).
   - Consider creating graphs, heatmaps, or charts to effectively communicate insights.

7. **Reporting**:
   - Prepare a brief report summarizing your methodology, analysis, findings, and visualizations. 
   - Include interpretations of the results and possible recommendations.

## Submission
- Submit your PySpark notebook (.ipynb) with well-documented code.
- Include the dataset or a link to the dataset used.
- Your report should be a PDF or markdown file summarizing the project for stakeholders who may not be familiar with data science.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Dataset Selection**: Relevance and complexity of the dataset chosen.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Depth of exploration and relevant statistics provided.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Methods used to clean and prepare the data.
- **Analysis and Insights**: Clarity and relevance of analysis performed.
- **Visualization**: Quality and clarity of visual representations.
- **Report Quality**: Overall structure, clarity, and completeness of the report.
